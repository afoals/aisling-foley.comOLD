		    	<h2>Background</h2>
		    	<p>
		    		PwC came to us with a problem; highly-skilled tax consultants were not being utilized fully. Many consultants were left ‘on the bench’ waiting for a new project.
		    	</p>
          <p>
            Our challenge was to understand their problem, develop a solution. Then rapidly develop a prototype that would prove the concept among their customers and staff.

      		<h2>My Approach</h2>
      		<p>
      			Following an initial kickoff meeting that helped the whole product team align on the business objectives and understand the problem that needed to be solved.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the approach I adopted to create a prototype that would get support from the business aswell as buy in from staff members and clients.

            Rather than presenting the user with one long form to fill in I wanted to create a more enjoyable and intuitive experience that brought them along the process step by step.

            The order page guided the user through the process one question at a time. The status bar kept them aware of how far along they were. While the summary panel on the right reminded them of exactly what they had chosen.

            It has gotten buy in from the organisation to proceed with it’s development. The next steps is to develop an MVP and have a beta launch in a smaller region.

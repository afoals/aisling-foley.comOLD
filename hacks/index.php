              I was really lucky to work at a company that valued experimentation and learning. We had quarterly hack days where we would hack together around a particular theme. At the end of the day teams would present their ‚Äúfinished‚Äù products and we would crown a winner.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Besides being loads of fun, hack days were great for collaborating with people we might not normally collaborate with, learning something new and fostering a culture of experimentation and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The projects I‚Äôve included were all conceptulised, designed and built in a day!

	    	<h2>Meteor Mission</h2>
    		<p>
    			The problem this hack tried to solve was grocery shopping with children. We imagined a busy parents trying to do their grocery shopping with an unhappy toddler grabbing at shelves and shouting to leave.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			Meteor mission aimed to keep the child entertained and engaged by turning grocery shopping into a outer space treasure hunt!
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			This concept involved a tablet based application and a shopping store with iBeacons located throughout.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			The parent would input their shopping list into the application and as the pair rolled around the store the child would be notified when a piece of treasure was in proximity.

      <h2>Hac Man</h2>
				<p>
					Our take on Pac-Man saw our characters trying to win the hack day by moving around a maze collecting all the coffee beans. While our evil colleagues attempted to foil us. Luckily eating pizza gave us the power to destroy them!
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	All the characters and sound effects were modeled on pebble {code} employees and we built using it using JS.

	    	<h2>IceBeacon</h2>
    		<p>
    			IceBeacon is curling without the ice! Our idea was to recreate the game of curling in our office using a projector, iBeacons and our phones.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			We projected the curling court onto the floor and slid our phones down it. iBeacons allowed us to pinpoint the location of the phones so that spectators could see it on their devices and interact with the game with sound effects such as boos and cheers.

    		<p>
					A 8 bit platformer that saw a baywatch era David Hasselhoff escaping Zombies and picking up burgers to fuel himself along the way! Accompanied by an 80‚Äôs synth soundtrack, that we created on the day, it had all the elements for greatness! üòÇ
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    	We attempted to build the game using JS and canvas. On the day we didn‚Äôt fully realise our vision but luckily it was resurrected a few days hacks later and created using Elm.

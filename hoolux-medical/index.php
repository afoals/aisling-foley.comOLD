	        		Hoolux Medical is a startup straddling the advertising and health industries. Their core mission is to increase patient health literacy in the USâ€¦and sell some advertising along the way!
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		The Hoolux Medical Device is attached to screens at point of care locations. It utilises facial recognition technology to detect the age and gender of viewers. This allowes Hoolux Medical to deliver targeted healthcare information and advertising content.

						<p>
							Hoolux Medical had an incredibly ambitious vision. I helped them get to market by conceptualising, prototyping, designing and developing their digital product offering.
						</p>

							This included marketing sites, analytics application, investor application, mobile application, sales platform and email campaigns with corresponding micro sites.

	    		<p>
	    			Inspired by the success of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud">gov.uk digital marketplace</a>. My clients vision was to replicate that model and launch world wide.
	    		</p>
				<p>
					They already had their first customer; an organisation working with schools in England and Wales.
				</p>

				<p>
					To help Inoket take it's first step towards world domination, the challenge was to design their product using the school market as a testing ground.

					Inoket had a big vision and an eager first customer, now all they need was a product! This is the approach I adopted to get them there:

		    	<h3>Workshop</h3>
		    	<p>
		    		I worked with a multidisciplinary team. We kicked the project off with an all day workshop with the key stakeholders. It was a great way to fully understand the problem we were tackling and align as a product team on:
			    </p>
			    <ul class="bullet">
				    <li>The product vision</li>
						<li>Long term goal</li>
						<li>Constraints and risks</li>
						<li>Target users</li>
			    </ul>
			    <br><h3>User Research</h3>
			    <p>
			 			Next I set out to understand how the schools market worked and how this product could succeed.
			 		</p>
			 		<p>
						I began conducting user research interviews with school business managers as well as their suppliers. The goal was to understand their current workflow and identify the frustrations they faced.
		    	</p>
		    	<p>
		    		I invited different members of the product team to join these interviews to give everyone an understanding of the users.
		    	</p>
		    	<br><h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
		    	<p>
		    		I also conducted a set of user interview with users of the government digital marketplace to understand the strengths and weakness of their product.

		 			I ran a series of user research interviews with school business managers to understand if the proposed system would work for supply teacher procurement.
		 		</p>
		 		<p>
					Also interviews with supply teacher agencies to get their perspective on the market and understand how they worked.
		    	</p>
		    	<p>
		    		It quickly became apparent the supply teaching category would not work on this platform. Supply teaching was a resource that needed to be filled immediately. The Inoket platform was going to introduce an extra layer of complexity that these busy people would not have time for.
